Hello! So once again, welcome to my blog!

Before I begin, I want to say that I am nobody important, and everything I write here is just my personal opinion. My thoughts are neither universally correct nor wrong, so if you disagree with me, that's perfectly fine. I’m not here to argue but to share my journey in the hope that it offers an interesting perspective to future graduate students.

## About This Blog

This blog is a space where I share my personal experiences and thoughts as a graduate student and researcher. It’s intended to provide insights into the ups and downs of academia for those on a similar journey.

The structure may evolve over time, but for now, it focuses on the three key stages of my academic path:

Early Stage: My beginnings at the University of South Florida.
Middle Stage: Continuing my work at Penn State University.
Final Stage: Attempting a Ph.D. again at Virginia Tech

## Closing Thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I hope to provide insights and experiences that resonate with future graduate students or researchers. Everyone's path is unique, and that’s what makes the journey so rewarding.

Feel free to share your thoughts or ask questions—this blog is as much about starting conversations as it is about sharing my experiences. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to refine and add to this space!
