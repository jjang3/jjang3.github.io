## Who Am I?
I am an engineer who recently defended his Ph.D. dissertation in July 2024 and is now a Cyber Engineer at [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/who-we-are) Corporation. 

I am an immigrant from South Korea who first moved to the United States of America when I was 10 years old (5th grade). Afterward, I moved around many different states, starting from New Mexico and moving all the way to Virginia. For the next few blog posts, I will briefly discuss my experiences as an immigrant from elementary school to high school to provide a bit of an introduction to myself.

## Elementary School (Part 1)

As a kid growing up in Korea, I was a hopeless kid who always caused problems. I honestly could not keep up with the [work-or-die culture](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/15/393939759/the-all-work-no-play-culture-of-south-korean-education) of Korean kids. You could say that I was a bit of a troublemaker; [skipping cram schools (or known as hagwons)](https://factsanddetails.com/korea/South_Korea/Education_Health_Transportation_Infrastructure/entry-7384.html), going to [PC bangs](https://blog.southofseoul.net/pc-bangs-korea/), and always brought games (e.g., [tamagochi](https://tamagotchi-official.com/us/)) to cause stress to my teachers. 

This changed when I unknowingly followed my mother to immigrate to the United States as my parents were going through a divorce. Funny enough, though, I did not know that my parents divorced until I became older (like three years or so later), as my parents decided to hide this fact as they thought it would cause me unnecessary stress. Anyhow, my mother thought it would be better for me to build my future in the United States rather than in Korea as she thought I would not be raised well under my dad, who was an alcoholic and physically abusive (this is not that big of a deal, I thought it was utterly normal in Korea tbh) along with the fact that I did not do very well in school.

I was amazed when I first arrived in the United States because... everything was **BIG**. I will never forget my first meal as a foreigner who landed. It was a cheeseburger from Carl's Jr, and it was just **gigantic**! Along with the fact that you could upgrade your drink to a **large** size for a mere 99 cents **with unlimited refills!!!!**, something I could never imagine in Korea. Furthermore, I would go to a grocery shop (I believe it was called Smith's) and was amazed at the fact soda cans were at least double the size of typical [Korean cans](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/aboAAOSwjVhjy4Tl/s-l1600.jpg) and those family size bags of chips were just astounding. These gargantuan factors caused my first of many problems: Obesity, which later became an important reminder to me to make sure to always stay healthy and fit during my Ph.D. tenure.

Furthermore, I realized that in America, you just could not get anywhere by walking (at least in New Mexico at that time), and public transportation was non-existent; you needed a car to drive anywhere. This caused my second of many problems: Boredom because I could not go to PC bangs like I could nor be able to eat anywhere I wanted; I was stuck in the apartment most of the time. Anyhow, now that I enjoyed those nice burgers and drinks for a few weeks in the apartment while not worrying about anything (I arrived during Summer Break in America), it was suddenly time for me to attend my first class as an elementary school student. My mother told me that I was going to a completely unknown place without knowing how to speak any English, and oh boy, it was a fascinating experience looking back. I will talk more about my elementary school experiences in the next post and hopefully can wrap it up.
